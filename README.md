# 📚 dotfiles

That's my dotfiles repo. I like to do it **simple** and **minimal**.

## 📦 What I use

- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) - shell
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) - fastest terminal ever
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - terminal multiplexer
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/) - text editor

## 🐺 What about the first setup?

Configuring a new machine doesn't have to be painful. See the `setup/` directory and check your flavor:
- [MacOS](setup/mac.sh)
- _Linux_ (TBD)

## 🤔 Why do you use X instead of Y?

Personal choices.

## 🧙‍♂️ Focused in simplicity?

Yes.
